L4D2-Stripper Source
====================

Just the http://hg.alliedmods.net/strippersource/ (7b6b696412c5) Stripper:Source build, with some adjustments to make it work on servers with outdated glibc version libraries (2.12 where 2.15+ is required).

Thanks to Crepes, who explained to me why Stripper didn't work on some linux systems.
